# Smart Voting System Using Deep Learning

## Introduction

The **Smart Voting System** is a web-based application designed to help people vote in a secure and fast way using **face recognition**. This system solves problems like voter fraud, slow manual voting, and lengthy counting processes by using **machine learning** and **computer vision** to ensure that the correct person is voting.

### How the System Works:

1. **Voter Registration:** Voters sign up on the website by entering their details and capturing their face image using a webcam.
2. **Face Recognition Voting:** When the voter wants to cast a vote, the system recognizes their face and allows them to vote securely.
3. **Admin Control:** Admins can add nominees for the election, manage voter registrations, and view voting results.
4. **Vote Counting:** The system counts votes automatically, and results can be seen shortly after the voting ends.

## Features

- **Voter Registration**: Securely register voters using personal details and face images.
- **Face Recognition for Voting**: Use face recognition to authenticate voters before they cast their votes.
- **Admin Portal**: Admins can add candidates, check registered voters, and view election results.
- **OTP Verification**: Send a One-Time Password (OTP) to the voter’s email to verify the registration.
- **Results Calculation**: Automatic calculation and display of results after voting.

## Prerequisites

Before you can install and run this project, you need the following software:

- **Python 3.x**: You can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system. You can download it from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).
- **Flask**: A web framework for Python.
- **OpenCV**: A computer vision library to capture and process images.
- **Other Python libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, Pymysql, Scikit-learn, etc.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Project

First, you need to download (clone) this project to your computer.

1. Open **Command Prompt** or **Terminal**.
2. Run this command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-voting-system.git
   ```

3. After it finishes downloading, go to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd smart-voting-system
   ```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)

A virtual environment helps you manage libraries separately for each project.

1. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On **Windows**:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On **macOS/Linux**:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

### Step 3: Install the Required Libraries

This project requires some Python libraries to work.

1. In your terminal (or command prompt), run:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install all the necessary libraries mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file like Flask, OpenCV, Pandas, etc.

## Setting Up Database

This project uses **MySQL** to store data like voter details and voting results.

### Step 1: Install MySQL

1. Download and install MySQL from [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).
2. Open MySQL Workbench or MySQL Command Line.

### Step 2: Create the Database

1. Log in to your MySQL instance.
2. Create a database for this project:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE smart_voting_system;
   ```

3. Create the tables for the project by running the SQL commands provided in the `database` folder. This folder contains the SQL schema to create the tables needed to store voters, nominees, and votes.

### Step 3: Update Database Connection Settings

1. Open the `app.py` file.
2. Look for the database connection part and replace it with your MySQL credentials:

   ```python
   mydb = pymysql.connect(
       host='localhost',
       user='root',
       password='your_password',
       database='smart_voting_system'
   )
   ```

## Running the Application

### Step 1: Start the Flask Application

1. From the project folder, run the following command to start the Flask server:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. After running this command, you will see something like:

   ```bash
   Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

3. Open a browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000).

### Step 2: Interacting with the Application

1. **Admin Access**:
   - Visit [http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:5000/admin).
   - Use the following credentials to log in as an admin:
     - **Email:** admin@voting.com
     - **Password:** admin

2. **Voter Registration**:
   - Go to the registration page: [http://127.0.0.1:5000/registration](http://127.0.0.1:5000/registration).
   - Fill in your details and follow the instructions to complete registration, including email verification and face image capture.

3. **Voting**:
   - After registration, go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/zptcvotinghom](http://127.0.0.1:5000/zptcvotinghom) to vote.
   - The system will use your webcam to recognize your face and allow you to cast your vote.

## Understanding the Code

Here’s a brief explanation of the important parts of the project:

### 1. `app.py`
- This is the main file that runs the web application using Flask.
- It contains routes (URLs) that direct users to different pages, like home, registration, voting, and results.
- **Example Routes**:
  - `/home`: Displays the home page.
  - `/registration`: Displays the voter registration form.
  - `/admin`: The admin login page.

### 2. Face Recognition Logic
- The system uses **OpenCV** to capture and detect faces using the camera.
- It uses the **LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram)** algorithm for face recognition, which converts the face image into a set of patterns that can be used to identify the voter.
- Images are captured during registration and stored in a folder.

### 3. Admin Functions
- The admin can add nominees, view voting results, and monitor the voter database.
- Admins can also train the face recognition model to recognize new voters by visiting the `/train` page.

### 4. Database Interaction
- The app interacts with the MySQL database using **pymysql** to store and retrieve voter information, votes, and nominee details.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MySQL Connection Failed**:
   - Ensure MySQL is running and your database credentials are correct in `app.py`.
  
2. **Webcam Not Detected**:
   - Make sure your webcam is properly connected to the computer and recognized by the system.
  
3. **Face Recognition Not Working**:
   - Ensure that the face images are captured correctly during registration. You can retrain the model by visiting `/train` as an admin.

4. **OTP Not Sent**:
   - Check if you’ve enabled less secure apps in your email account. Make sure to provide the correct email and password in `app.py`.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Implement stronger security measures like encryption for stored data.
- Add support for mobile devices and additional languages.
- Improve the face recognition speed and accuracy by using more advanced algorithms.
